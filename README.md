## 🚀 About The Project

**[Time to Read Calculator](https://timetoreadcalculator.doodax.com)** is a precision-engineered web application designed to help writers, SEO specialists, and developers estimate reading duration with accuracy.

Understanding content length is pivotal for User Experience (UX) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). By providing readers with an estimated reading time, content creators can manage expectations, reduce bounce rates, and improve overall engagement metrics.

This application distinguishes itself through:
- **Instantaneous Calculation**: Asynchronous, real-time analysis of text input.
- **Adaptive Algorithms**: Adjustable Words Per Minute (WPM) settings to model different user personas (e.g., detailed study vs. quick skimming).
- **Privacy-First Design**: Zero-latency, client-side processing ensures that sensitive drafts never leave the user's browser.
- **Immersive Aesthetics**: A responsive, galaxy-themed interface powered by HTML5 Canvas to make utility feel premium.

---

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Real-Time Analysis**: Metrics update instantly as you type or paste content.
-   **Dynamic WPM Control**: A slider to adjust reading speed from 1 WPM up to professional skimming speeds.
-   **Privacy-Centric**: 100% client-side execution. No data transmission, no server storage.
-   **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile environments.
-   **SEO Knowledge Base**: Integrated guide on reading metrics and content strategy.
